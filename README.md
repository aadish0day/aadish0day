# Hey, I'm Aadish! 👋

I'm a developer focused on optimizing workflows, building high-performance projects, and diving deep into the mysteries of memory management. Oh, and along the way, I'm all about creating some really awesome software.

### Fun Facts:
- Proud Arch Linux user btw. Yes, I had to mention it. 🎩
- Neovim enthusiast — because who doesn’t want to wield their keyboard like a true wizard? ⌨️✨ Check out my [Neovim config](https://github.com/aadish0day/neovim.git)!
- I've probably spent more time configuring my editor than writing code (it's all part of the process!).
- I break things just to fix them better. Consider it "trial by fire." 
- Still figuring out why my code works... when it does.

### What I’m working on:
- 🔭 Perfecting my dotfiles to make them the gold standard for developer setups. [Dotfiles Repo](https://github.com/aadish0day/dotfile.git)! 🔧
- 🌱 Learning to tackle memory management like a pro (while avoiding those pesky leaks).
- 💬 Ask me why I prefer Neovim over IDEs — but bring coffee, it’s a long conversation.
- 🛠 Building performant software that probably won’t crash... at least, most of the time.

### Find me:
- 🖥 On my terminal, obviously.
