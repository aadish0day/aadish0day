# Hey, I'm Aadish! 👋

I'm a software developer specializing in workflow optimization, high-performance application development, and systems programming with a particular focus on memory management. I build reliable, efficient software solutions while maintaining a passion for clean code and elegant architectures.

## Technical Philosophy
- **Arch Linux user** — because choosing your own adventure extends to operating systems 🐧
- **Neovim advocate** — transforming text editing into an art form with [my custom configuration](https://github.com/aadish0day/neovim.git) ⌨️
- **Configuration enthusiast** — I believe the right development environment is half the battle won
- **Iterative problem solver** — I embrace the "break it to understand it" methodology
- **Pragmatic developer** — writing code that works, then making it work better

## Current Focus Areas
🔭 **Developer Tooling**: Crafting and refining [dotfiles](https://github.com/aadish0day/dotfile.git) for optimal development workflows

🌱 **Systems Programming**: Deep-diving into memory management patterns and performance optimization techniques

🛠 **Software Architecture**: Building robust, scalable applications with emphasis on reliability and maintainability

💬 **Developer Experience**: Always happy to discuss the merits of terminal-based development workflows (coffee recommended for extended conversations)

## Professional Interests
- Performance optimization and profiling
- Developer productivity tools and automation
- System-level programming and resource management
- Open source contribution and community building
